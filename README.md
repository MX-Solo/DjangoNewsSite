# Django News Site

A Django-based web application for managing and publishing news articles. This project is designed to demonstrate Django's capabilities, including user authentication, content management, and an admin panel.

---

## Features

- User authentication (register, login, logout).
- Admin panel for managing users and articles.
- CRUD operations for news articles.
- Responsive design for better user experience on various devices.
- Configured to run in Docker containers for easy deployment.
- Automated database backups to AWS S3 using Docker.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.9 or later
- Django 4.2 or later
- PostgreSQL (or SQLite for development)
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for containerized deployment)

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MX-Solo/DjangoNewsSite.git
cd DjangoNewsSite
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure the Database

1. Edit `settings.py` to configure the database connection.
2. Run migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Access the site at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

---

## Docker Deployment

### 1. Using Docker Compose

Docker Compose simplifies the deployment process by orchestrating services.

#### Build and Start the Containers

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

#### Access the Application

- Web application: `http://localhost:8000`
- Admin Panel: `http://localhost:8000/admin`

---

### 2. Backup Service with AWS S3

A secondary service is included in `docker-compose.yml` to automatically back up the SQLite database to AWS S3 daily.

#### Configure AWS Credentials

Update the following environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_BUCKET_NAME`
- `DATABASE_FILE`

#### Backup Command Logic

The backup service uploads the database to S3 every 24 hours.

---

## Environment Variables

To configure the application and services, you can set the following environment variables:

| Variable                   | Default Value         | Description                          |
|----------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `DEBUG`                    | `1`                   | Enable or disable debug mode         |
| `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS`     | `localhost 127.0.0.1` | Allowed hosts for Django application |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`        | `your_access_key`     | AWS access key                       |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`    | `your_secret_key`     | AWS secret access key                |
| `AWS_BUCKET_NAME`          | `your_bucket_name`    | Name of the AWS S3 bucket            |
| `DATABASE_FILE`            | `/app/db.sqlite3`     | Path to the SQLite database file     |

For security, store sensitive data in a `.env` file and use a library like `python-decouple`.

---

## Testing

Run the Django test suite to ensure everything works as expected:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

## Security Considerations

1. Use a strong password for the Django superuser in production.
2. Configure HTTPS for secure communication.
3. Use a production-ready database like PostgreSQL.
4. Keep sensitive data (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`, database credentials) in environment variables.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add feature-name'`.
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature-name`.
5. Open a pull request.

---

## Automated Backups

The backup service in `docker-compose.yml` ensures regular backups of the SQLite database to AWS S3. It runs continuously and uploads the database every 24 hours.

For more information, refer to the `docker-compose.yml` file.
